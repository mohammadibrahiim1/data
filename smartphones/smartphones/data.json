    "title": "Why people still love retro technology like iPods and instant-film cameras?",
    "blog": "That beaten up Walkman buried in your basement might be someone's hot new accessory. The retro tech market is alive and kicking.\nIn May, Apple refreshed the iPod touch for the first time in four years. Vinyl record sales clocked in at 400 million on average over the past four years, according to data from data tracker Statista. DVD player sales are trending downward, but they still consistently hit four million units sold every holiday quarter, even as recently as 2018.\nOther gadgets that have stayed the course: camcorders, radios, clock radios, desk phones, and DVRs. Millions of these are still in use in US households in 2017, according to Statista.\n\nWhat drives people to continue purchasing vinyl records, instant film cameras, and iPods, long after new products have made those objects irrelevant?\n\nOlder gadgets have a lot of staying power because they allow people to unplug from the constant ping of smartphones and tablets.\n\"There's a growing segment of people that would like to be disconnected but still have access to the things they want,\" said Ryan Reith, program vice president of mobile devices at International Data Corporation, \"So it fills a void in the market.\"\nMany vintage products attract a strong cult following. For example, IPod lovers anticipate Apple's product refreshes on social media and online forums.\n\nApple (AAPL) also appears to be targeting kids in its iPod marketing, according to Paul Gagnon, executive director of research and analysis at IHS Markit.\n\"The brands are starting to build a young consumer base and then eventually transition them as they grow older to more expensive products the company might also make,\" he noted.\nInstant cameras with film are also popular among teens. Fujifilm, which makes Polaroid-like cameras with film that instantly develops, said its sales are holding steady. In its fiscal year ending in March, it sold over 10 million cameras and smartphone printers worldwide. Fujifilm says it's been able to cross generational boundaries by attracting photographers in the digital age.\n\nNostalgia plays a big part in old tech's popularity, too. It can give people that comforting feeling of their childhoods or remind them of a specific time and place.\nOn social media networks like Tumblr and Pinterest, vintage images rack up thousands of likes and shares. Disposable cameras often trend on Pinterest (PINS).\n\"The pace of companies selling new devices and forcing old technology into obsolescence means that certain devices are associated with certain periods in history,\" said Michael Connor, artistic director of Rhizome, a digital art organization.\nVintage gadgets can help people enjoy technology while allowing people to feel connected to the real world. Smartphones often have the opposite effect.\nThat's why people still buy alarm clocks and calculators, even though a smartphone has all those functions.\n\"The smartphone is a bit of a Swiss Army knife. But it's not necessarily specialized,\" said Gagnon.\nSome people will find it easy to use the phone to replace all those older gadgets, he said. But \"a lot of people out there either don't own a smartphone, or for them using those functions is not easy. For those people, legacy products will always exist.\"\nAnd some people like the artistry of older gadgets. People seek out physical items, but they want \"a filtered, idealized version\" of those things, said Amanda Brennan, Tumblr's \"meme librarian\" and head of content insights and social.\n\n\"Polaroids often look blurry, vinyl sound quality is nowhere near an MP3 or stream — but it makes them feel more vibrant, more real-life,\" she said.\nOlder products carry with them unique experiences. Connor, the artistic director, describes how a pixel looks different on an old cathode-ray-tube monitor when compared with a modern-day display. On a CRT monitor, a pixel has a \"soft low res quality\" that can be artistically appealing, said Connor.\n",

Unfortunately, the console’s high price tag of $599 and poor selection of games made Pippin obsolete soon. Pippin remains the only game console Apple has ever made.\n",

The device was huge, a single white box with a 30-pin dock connector to dock your iPod. The iPod Hi-Fi was controlled using Apple’s universal IR remote.\n\nWhile it was a great speaker with excellent audio quality, the iPod Hi-Fi only worked with third-generation iPods or those that came after. Many also found the $349 price hard to swallow. The iPod Hi-Fi was discontinued in 2007 after being on the market for 20 months.\n",

It also had an infrared networking capability that lets you beam emails and messages from it wirelessly.\n\nOn paper, Newton seemed to be a perfect device, but the execution was flawed. The handwriting recognition was bad and the data transfer was slow. Apple released seven models in over six years before the Newton line was killed by Jobs upon returning to the company in 1997.\n",

It had a binocular-like design and captured images at 640×480 and could snap eight photographs. The QuickTake was essentially a 0.3MP camera. A total of three models were released before Steve Jobs discontinued the QuickTake lineup after taking the charge of Apple in 1997.\n",

The limited-edition computer showed Apple’s design prowess and the ability to sell a $7,499 all-in-one PC to consumers in the late 1990s. It was designed by a young Jony Ive. The TAM wasn’t another AIO.\n\n\nThe Mac was pitched as a complete home entertainment solution with a 12.1-inch LCD screen, a custom Bose stereo speaker, leather palm rests on the keyboard, a built-in TV / FM tuner and remote, and a CD-ROM drive. The machine was constructed with gold-colored plastic, fabric, and Italian leather. Only 12,000 units of TAMs were made. The device was so exclusive that a person in a tuxedo would come and set up the Mac at customer’s homes. If you are interested in the 20th Anniversary Macintosh, you can still buy used ones on eBay for upwards of $2000.\n",

The Macintosh TV essentially used a 14-inch Sony Trinitron CRT display and the included card-sized remote could be used to control it. The Mac resembled a Macintosh LC 500 series, but it was fitted with a TV tuner that converted into a fully-backed TV set.\n\nA device that combines a Macintosh computer, a cable-ready TV set, and the ability to play CDs through the stereo system was unheard of at that time. One big issue with the Macintosh TV was that it was too expensive. Arguably, the biggest disappointment of the Macintosh TV was that you could not watch TV and use the Mac at the same time. The all-back coloured Macintosh was only released in the US. Apple only manufactured 10,000 units of the Macintosh TV before killing the machine four months after its launch.\n",

Rather than sticking to a traditional tower design, Jony Ive thought of creating a computer that was an eight-inch cube suspended in a thick, translucent base. The design was to give the impression that the machine was floating in the air. The G4 Cube was fanless, making it extremely quiet.\n\nThe machine was an experiment of sorts of creating a computer for those who want the goodness of an iMac but don’t need all the power of the G4 Tower. The lack of expandability and low-end specifications miffed many power users. In July 2001, even before the device completed a year, Apple discontinued the G4 Cube. The $1800 might not be the massive success Apple had originally anticipated, the G4 Cube remains the company’s best-looking Mac ever created. The New York Museum of Modern Art has a G4 Cube as part of its collection.\n",

Not many remember this, but the iSight was the first Apple product to be crafted out of aluminum.\n\nThe iSight was designed to be mounted on the Mac’s display or on your desk. It featured a 1/4-inch CCD sensor with a F/2.8 aperture lens and a resolution of 640x480p. One of the best parts of the iSight was a mechanical privacy shutter that could be opened and closed by twisting the ring around the lens. It also came with a dual-element microphone for noise suppression. The iSight was designed to work with the PowerBook G4 Aluminum, iBook G4, and the iMac G4. A year later, Apple included a built-in web camera in the iMac G54. The iSight webcam was officially discontinued in 2008.\n",

It ran on Newton OS and came with handwriting recognition, stylus and up to 28 hours of battery on a full charge.\n\nIncidentally, the eMate 300 was also the first Apple notebook to run on an ARM processor. And yes, it supported a touchscreen display. First introduced in March 1997 for $800, the eMate 300 was discontinued, along with the entire Newton line in 1998.
